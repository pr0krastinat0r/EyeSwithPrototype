Hello curious stranger! This project's was created by a Game Design student looking for an internship. The goal is to showcase my scripting and game designing skills in particular genre of a 3D platformer. 
This is why I've tried using absolute minimum of assets, those that I do use, mostly for visual purposes, will be credited below:

-Gridbox Prototype Material by Ciathyza
-Customizable skybox by Key Mouse.

You can also read my development diary where I explain my thought proccess, read narrative of the game, see some moodboards etc. at:

If you have any feedback, questions or propositions, don't hesitate to contact me at maxhusak.wordpress.com 

P.s Yes I didn't pay 5$ to remove wordpress for the domain, I'm a poor student, don't judge me. Love.
